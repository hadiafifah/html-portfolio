<h1>Ifa's Best Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>(Actually just what came to me off the top of my head rn)</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Boy and the Heron</h3>
<p>Simple! I just watched this film, and it has given me a sip of ghibli into my Hayao Miyazaki-deprived life.
    The story-telling, animation, and overall vibe is just chefs kiss!
</p>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>An OG. I can't really put my finger on it, but it's just so complex and beautiful. I want to have
    such a domestic and inter-dimensional love like the main character's do one day. Will it be with
    Faisal? I really don't know.

<h3>Totoro</h3>
<p>THE OG OG. I JUST LOVE IT IT IS MY AESTHETIC PERIODDDD</p>
