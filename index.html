    <img src="./assets/images/movieranks.png" height="150" />
    <p>I was so braindead and worried about the wrong things when working on this. I dont think
        this ranking is actually accurate to how I really feel. Well--it is, but 
        I'm sure I have many more thoughts and potential movies that could've been on here.

    <img src="./assets/images/bdayinvite.png" height="150" />
    <p>The original assignment was to write a birthday invite for your own birthday, 
        but Faisal's birthday is coming up sooner so I thought I'd do it for 
        his instead.</p>
